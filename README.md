# Javascript-School-App
This Javascript project was built for my training in PeopleCert Education Coding Bootcamp.

My purpose was to create a fully functional school website, that tackles all the necessary functionalities that 
a school needs. The website is created with a minimal outlook in order to be user friendly and easy to use without
a lot of instructions.

This project helped me learn Vanilla Javascript and manipulate HTML pages using JS.

It contains web pages for the following entities: Courses, Trainers, Students, Assignments.
The user has the ability to:
  1. Add / Edit Form for Courses, Trainers, Students, Assignments.
  2. Add / Edit Form for Trainers per Course, Students per Course, Assignments per Course.
  - Edit is made to be extremely efficient and not causing any bugs by Hiding/Unhiding the appropiate buttons.

Project files are divided in 3 folders.
(1) css: contains the stylesheet for the templates.
(2) scripts: contains the scripts written in javascript.
(3) templates: contains each template/page of the website.

Templates and their corresponding scripts are named in a similar way.
(e.g "courses.html" and "courses_script.js")

In order to launch the application run the "main_page.html" file in "templates" folder.
